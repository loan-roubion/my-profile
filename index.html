			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					<p>
						<blockquote>

							I am currently studying at IÉSEG School of Management, a post-bac business school located in Lille (59000), France. However, I was not always a "north guy". In fact, I come from the French riviera, in the south of France. Yes ! This is what you are thinking about, one of the most visited place on earth, full of beaches, landscapes, and seaside resorts !

			<h2>Sports</h2>
					
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							
							I agree with you, to talk about sports in a student website can be seen as a stereotype... 😆 Nonetheless, sport plays a big part of my life so it's compulsory for me to discuss it. I practiced a lot of sports during my life, of all types : biking, handball, tennis, running, judo,... I will not mention them all but here is a link to my handball club's facebook page, as it is the sport I practised the most !

			<h2>Music</h2>

					<p>
						<blockquote>
						
							Music is a passion since my younger age. I played a lot of instruments (drums, guitar, piano, ...), and nowadays my main hobby is rap music. I produce "beats" and I write lyrics on those before recording myself ! Underneath is the first song I ever wrote (I was 14 years old 👶), feel free to listen to it !

			<h2>Associations</h2>
					
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							
							Besides my studies, I feel the need to engage into different associations during my sparetime. I organized a food collection for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/croix-rouge-fran-aise/" target="_blank" >La Croix Rouge Française</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/emma%C3%BCs-france/" target="_blank">Emmaüs France</a>. In addition, I am part of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bureau-des-jeux-ieseg-lille/" target="_blank">Bureau des Jeux</a> at my school and I plan to join other organizations until the end of my studies (I already have a project with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/unicef/" target="_blank">Unicef</a> in the next months 😌).
